Description : Architectural Base for UE4 project with a bunch of stuff and a few feature to show example of how architecture work in UE4. Project done based on what I learn while working in the industry. Note that It is a WIP, expect changes and update in the near future. CPP only.

Hello there.
So basically, what I want to propose with this project is a base project with a base architecture for Unreal Engine 4 in CPP. I will try top keep the class simple and light.
I will just add a few feature related to what I did just to show how it is, and how a project should look like in the industry from my newly acquired experience.
There is not 1 answer to every problem, but billion of them when it comes to programming, and I will just show my vision, my answer, of how OOP under UE4 CPP should work.
I may do mistakes while doing some stuff inside of the project, but it is part of the learning process. Being a programmer is an endless learning process, like living an adventure right ?

So yeah, basically, it is in WIP, and I will work on it whenever I want, and I have time !

Please if you don't agree with what I do, let me know using the best of your critical mind to write me a nice comment.
I will not read or consider any harmful, or rude comments, so be mindful !
